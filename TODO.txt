Clean up:
 - Make the collision detection clearer
 - [DONE] Make the cue ball just a normal ball at position 0 in the balls list
 - [DONE] Declare the colours in the constants file and then use them elsewhere
 - Add a collision class that handles collisions
 - Collision matrix of all colliding bodies
 - Run a recheck every few frames to force collisions to stop
 - Use a leapfrog integration scheme

New features necessary for pool
 - [DONE] Hit ball with cue
 - [DONE] Draw line to show where things are heading
 - [DONE] Sink balls
