Clean up:
 - Make the collision detection clearer
 - [DONE] Make the cue ball just a normal ball at position 0 in the balls list
 - [DONE] Declare the colours in the constants file and then use them elsewhere
 - Add a collision class that handles collisions
 - Collision matrix of all colliding bodies
 - Run a recheck every few frames to force collisions to stop
 - Use a leapfrog integration scheme

New features necessary for pool
 - Hit ball with cue
 - [DONE] Draw line to show where things are heading
 - Sink balls
 - Turns, score

Background stuff to make game better
 - [DONE] Frame time stuff
 - Real scale vs screen scale

Fun things to add after
 - Different AI opponents with levels of ability to play pool
 - Render balls with a super simple blin phong
 - Handle ball collisions in 3D for rotation
